# BrnDataHandler
An application to help parse various data formats and properly identify/sort them, in the context of recovered Burnout builds. May abstract into a more general tool later on.

## Goals
Looking to further parse each file type and identify properties such as: 
- Build config (External/Artist/Internal)
- Bundle type (TRK, APT, etc)
- Sound streams
